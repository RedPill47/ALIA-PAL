    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "1. What is the primary purpose of functions in programming?",
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "options": [
          "A) To simplify code and avoid repetition",
          "B) To create complex data structures",
          "C) To store variables persistently",
          "D) To increase the execution speed of programs"
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Functions help simplify code by allowing you to avoid repetition and make your code more modular."
      },
      {
        "question": "2. True or False: The body of a function executes immediately when the function is defined.",
        "type": "true-false",
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "The body of a function executes only when the function is called, not upon definition."
      },
      {
        "question": "3. What does the following line of code represent: 'def myMin(x, y):'?",
        "type": "short-answer",
        "answer": "It defines a function named myMin that takes two parameters, x and y.",
        "explanation": "This line uses the 'def' keyword to declare a function. The function can now be called with two arguments."
      },
      {
        "question": "4. When a function is called, what is the first step Python performs with the arguments?",
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "options": [
          "A) Binding parameters",
          "B) Evaluating arguments",
          "C) Executing the function body",
          "D) Returning to the caller"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Python first evaluates the expressions of the arguments provided in the function call."
      },
      {
        "question": "5. True or False: A function will return None if no return statement is executed.",
        "type": "true-false",
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "If a function executes without encountering a return statement, it will return None automatically."
      },
      {
        "question": "6. Explain what happens when a return statement is executed inside a function.",
        "type": "short-answer",
        "answer": "The function exits, returning the specified value to the caller, and control flow goes back to the point where the function was called.",        
        "explanation": "When a return is executed, the function's execution stops and returns the value to the caller."
      },
      {
        "question": "7. What is the syntax of a function call in Python?",
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "options": [
          "A) function_name.parameters()",
          "B) function_name(arguments)",
          "C) function_name{arguments}",
          "D) function_name: arguments"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The correct syntax is function_name(arguments), where function_name is the name of the function being called."
      },
      {
        "question": "8. Identify the parameters in the function definition: 'def myMin(x, y):'",
        "type": "short-answer",
        "answer": "x and y",
        "explanation": "x and y are the parameters of the function myMin, used to receive the values when the function is called."
      },
      {
        "question": "9. What happens after the last statement in a function's body is executed?",
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "options": [
          "A) The program ends",
          "B) Control returns to the caller",
          "C) A new function starts",
          "D) An error may occur"
        ],
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Once the last statement is executed, control flow returns to the caller where the function was invoked."
      },
      {
        "question": "10. True or False: You can modify existing functions in Python.",
        "type": "true-false",
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "In Python, you can modify existing functions by redefining them or changing their parameters and logic."
      }
    ]
