      {
        "question": "What does a function do in Python?",
        "options": [
          "A) It makes the program run slower.",
          "B) It organizes code into reusable blocks.",
          "C) It closes the program.",
          "D) It has no effect on the code."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A function helps organize code into reusable blocks, making it easier to understand and maintain."

      {
        "question": "How do you call a function in Python?",
        "options": [
          "A) By writing its name followed by parentheses.",
          "B) By just writing its name without anything.",
          "C) By using a special keyword.",
          "D) Functions cannot be called."
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "To call a function, you write its name followed by parentheses, e.g., `my_function()`."

      {
        "question": "What keyword do you use to define a function in Python?",
        "options": [
          "A) create",
          "B) function",
          "C) def",
          "D) define"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The keyword `def` is used to define a function in Python, followed by the function name and parentheses."
      },
      {
        "question": "What will this code print?",
        "code": "def greet():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\ngreet()",
        "options": [
          "A) Hello",
          "B) Hello, World!",
          "C) World!",
          "D) Nothing"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The `greet()` function prints \"Hello, World!\", so when we call the function, it outputs this text."
      },
      {
        "question": "What can you pass to a function as parameters?",
        "options": [
          "A) Only numbers",
          "B) Only strings",
          "C) Any type of data",
          "D) No data is allowed"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "You can pass any type of data to a function as parameters, including numbers, strings, lists, and more."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the output of the following code?",
        "code": "def add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nresult = add(3, 5)\nprint(result)",
        "options": [
          "A) 8",
          "B) 35",
          "C) 3+5",
          "D) Error"
        ],
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The `add` function takes two parameters, adds them, and returns the result, which is then printed. In this case, `3 + 5` equals `8`."
