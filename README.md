ALIA-PAL is an innovative educational framework that leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized and adaptive learning experiences. The system combines LangGraph's decision-making capabilities with CrewAI's multi-agent architecture to create a dynamic learning environment that continuously adapts to student needs.

## Key Features

- Dynamic scaffolding adaptation based on real-time student performance
- Multi-agent system for specialized educational tasks
- Integration with teacher-provided materials through RAG
- Real-time monitoring and adjustment of learning paths
- Structured human-in-the-loop validation process

## Architecture

The system uses LangGraph as its core decision-making engine while implementing specialized educational agents through CrewAI. This dual-layer approach enables both high-level learning strategy orchestration and granular pedagogical interventions.
